### BUILDING  INSURANCE CLAIM PREDICTION
#### Business Understanding
##### Research Question
Our client is Boseman Insurance company. We have been appointed as the Lead Data Analysts to build a predictive model to determine if a building will have an insurance claim during a certain period or not. We are required to predict the probability of having at least one claim over the insured period of the building.

##### Business Overview
Our homes and investment properties are most often our biggest asset, so it makes sense to want to protect them. Building insurance, also referred to as ‘home only insurance’ does just that. While building cover varies slightly between insurers, it generally covers damage caused to an insured property from a wide variety of events including fire, flooding , storm, impact (such as by a car or falling tree), explosion, riot, vandalism and earthquake.

##### Justification.
There has been an increase in the number of building collapses in Lagos and major cities in Nigeria. As an insurance company that specialises in buildings, understanding the customers is very crucial.  The ability to predict  whether a  building will have an insurance claim or not, is useful in identifying potential customers  as well as guiding future company policies.

##### Objectives.

1.To identify the locations/ settlements with  high or  low  insurance claim rates.


2.To find out which building types have the highest or lowest insurance claim rate.


3.To determine whether fenced buildings have lower/higher insurance claim rates than unfenced buildings.


4.To build a model that predicts whether a building will have an insurance claim or not.
